# react-redux-async-training

To start run: <br />
1) npm install <br />
2) npm start <br />
<br />

This is playground to train redux with react. <br /> <br />

Used: <br />
1) ESLint and recommended rules <br />
2) Webpack (extracted "libs/vendor" chunk in configuration) with webpack-dev-server and react-hot-loader from gaearon <br />
3) Babel with ES6 and react presets and babel-polyfill <br />
4) React <br />
5) Redux with react-redux and middlewares (redux-thunk, redux-logger) <br />
<br />

For debugging: <br />
1) change devtool property in webpack.config.js (from 'eval' to the e.g. 'source-map') <br />
2) install Redux DevTools (e.g. as Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd ) <br />
